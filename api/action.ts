How do I make my bot log in?
After connecting to the server, it will send a |challstr| message containing a nonce. From here, there are two different ways to select an account. These will be explained separately.

How do I make my bot log in to an unregistered account?
Make a GET request to https://play.pokemonshowdown.com/~~showdown/action.php. The following parameters must be included in the URL:

act: must be getassertion
userid: must be the user ID you want to use
challstr: the nonce you received from the server
For example, here's the HTTP request for a GET request to attempt to use "morfent" as a username:

GET /~~showdown/action.php?act=getassertion&userid=morfent&challstr=4|... HTTP/1.1
Host: play.pokemonshowdown.com
The server will return what's called an assertion as a response. The following are considered errors:

if the assertion is just ";", this indicates that the username given is registered
if the assertion begins with ";;", this indicates any other type of error occurred while logging in
What to do with the assertion will be explained later.

How do I make my bot log in to a registered account?
Make a POST request to https://pokemonshowdown.com/~~showdown/action.php. A Content-Type header must be specified as being application/x-www-form-urlencoded; encoding=UTF-8. The body of the request must be a JSON object containing the following keys:

act: must be "login"
name: the username wanted
pass: the password wanted
challstr: the nonce received from the server
For example, here's an HTTP request to log in as "bongsniffer69" (note: lacks a real nonce):

POST /~~showdown/action.php HTTP/1.1
Host: play.pokemonshowdown.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded; encoding=UTF-8

act=login&name=bongsniffer69&pass=notmyrealpasswordlol&challstr=4%7C...
The server will return what's called an assertion as a response. It is another JSON object prefixed with "]". Most of the metadata included isn't important; here's all you need to care about, given a variable data containing the JSON object:

if data.curuser.loggedin is false, either the username, password, or challstr was incorrect
if data.assertion starts with ";;", any other type of error occurred while logging in
Keep data.assertion and ignore the rest of the metadata. What you do with the assertion will be explained later.

OK, I have an assertion, now what do I do with it?
Send a /trn message to the global room. /trn takes three parameters, separated by commas:

a username
an avatar
an assertion
For example:

|/trn Morfent,128,4|...
